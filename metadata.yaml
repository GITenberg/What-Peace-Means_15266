description: This little book contains three plain sermons which were preached in
  New York in the Easter season of 1919, in the Park Avenue Presbyterian Church, of
  which my son is minister. I had no thought that they would ever be printed. They
  were, and are, just daily bread discourses meant to serve the spiritual needs of
  a congregation of Christian people, seekers after truth, inquirers about duty, strangers
  and pilgrims, in the great city and the troubled world. But if, as friends think,
  these simple chapters may be of service through the printed page to a larger circle
  of readers, I willingly and free.
